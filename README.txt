This program is a pulse-to-tone converter for the Western Electric model 500 rotary telephone.

A TI MSP430 microcontroller is used to interpret the rotary signal from the telephone dial pad and push it to the telephone line as a cross of the frequencies associated with the tone of the number recieved.
